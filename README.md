## Objectives

  1. Understand what functions are
  2. Return a result from a function

## Outline

  * The goal here is to teach just enough about functions so that the students can run tests and such
  * Show doing some sort of operation, maybe calculate tax on a number
  * Oh hey, I need to do it in two different places, copy paste
  * Oh hey, I need to do it in three different places, copy paste
  * Bad. let's make functions
  * Functions have output, so a return statement
  * In this case, it needs to return the tax value
  * Don't worry about arguments or really anything else. We just need functions for testing right now.
